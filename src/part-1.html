      <h1>Part One: Welcome to Eagleton labs</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, dear inventor-in-training. In this lab we research and build web
        components to be used by the folks upstairs. If you do good work you
        might one day get to meet them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's your workstation and back there that's the coffee machine. Oh,
        when it was cleaned last? I don't know, do machines like that need
        cleaning?
      </p>
      <p>Nevermind.</p>
      <p>
        As you can see there's already a stack of requests on your desk for
        various web components that the upstairsfolk need to be crafted. Here's
        your complementary company mug for your coffee imbibement. I won't close
        the door on my way out so the airdraft can circulate away some of that
        mold smell. Best of luck with your work!

        <h2>The name plate</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, this assignment is from me, your boss that just left out the
          door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed that there is no name plate on your door, nor on your desk.
          Could you please fashion yourself a web-component with your name and
          place it on your desk?
        </p>
        <script>
          // Create and define a web component here for a <name-plate></name-plate>
          // component. You can start by defining the component here and then
          // moving it into its own file.

        <h2>The misplaced slide-clicker</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, it's Wanda from the backend engineering department. We seem to
          have misplaced the code for advancing our web-based powerpoint
          implementation. As it stands we're unable to move any of our
          presentations beyond the first slide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, we would have built this ourselves but our draconic company
          policy prevents backend developers and frontend developers from
          working on each other's domain of expertise. I damn near had to
          smuggle this message to you on a paperplane.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what we need from you is a slide-clicker component that can
          dispatch events to our "powerpointer-3000" machine. Attached to this
          letter you'll find a floppy disk with a copy of the powerpointer code.
          Good luck!
        </p>

          customElements.define('powerpointer-3000', Powerpointer3000)
        </script>
        <some-hints>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Search the codebase and have a peek at the source code of the
              powerpointer-3000.mjs file.

            <li>

        <h2>The creativity protector</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, it's Greg from accounts. I am in need of a font-style component
          that would prevent my colleagues from overriding my text styling with
          their CSS !important rules. They say I'm not a designer and should not
          be specifying font-styles but why can't accountants be allowed to add
          some extra flair to their text?
        </p>
        <p>
          Attached below you can see an example of the styling that my
          colleagues use to supress my creative juices. Please build me a web
          component that will style and protect my precious text.
        </p>
        <your-desk>
          <style>
            .creativity-blocker {
              padding: 12px;
            }
            .creativity-blocker p {
              font-family: sans-serif !important;
            }
          </style>
          <div class="creativity-blocker">
            <p style="font-family: cursive">
              Here's some text that I'd wish would have some extra flair! But it
              didn't help putting style attributes directly on the paragraph.
              And I cannot touch the actual CSS that we have.
            </p>
            <script type="module">
              import { CreativityProtector } from '/_solutions/solution-creativity-protector.mjs'
            </script>
            <!-- Tip: You should create a web component that can wrap the text above so that they can get their creative juices unblocked. -->
          </div>
        </your-desk>

        <some-hints>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A web component can use the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Slot"
                >slot element</a
              >
              to display content it wraps inside it, but that's not useful here
              because the host page's styling can still reach it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Instead you should create some shadowDOM and copy the web
              component's children into the shadowDOM.
            </li>
          </ul>
