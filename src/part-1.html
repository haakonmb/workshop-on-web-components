      <h1>Part One: Welcome to Eagleton labs</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, dear inventor-in-training. In this lab we research and build web
        components to be used by the folks upstairs. If you do good work you
        might one day get to meet them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's your workstation and back there that's the coffee machine. Oh,
        when it was cleaned last? I don't know, do machines like that need
        cleaning?
      </p>
      <p>Nevermind.</p>
      <p>
        As you can see there's already a stack of requests on your desk for
        various web components that the upstairsfolk need to be crafted. Here's
        your complementary company mug for your coffee imbibement. I won't close
        the door on my way out so the airdraft can circulate away some of that
        mold smell. Best of luck with your work!
      </p>

        <h2>The name plate</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, this assignment is from me, your boss that just left out the
          door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed that there is no name plate on your door, nor on your desk.
          Could you please fashion yourself a web-component with your name and
          place it on your desk?
        </p>
        <script>
          // Create and define a web component here for a <name-plate></name-plate>
          // component. You can start by defining the component here and then
          // moving it into its own file.
        </script>
        <style>
          .your-desk {
            max-width: 300px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 8px;
          }
        </style>
        <div class="your-desk">

        <h2>The misplaced slide-clicker</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, it's Wanda from the backend engineering department. We seem to
          have misplaced the code for advancing our web-based powerpoint
          implementation. As it stands we're unable to move any of our
          presentations beyond the first slide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, we would have built this ourselves but our draconic company
          policy prevents backend developers and frontend developers from
          working on each other's domain of expertise. I damn near had to
          smuggle this message to you on a paperplane.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what we need from you is a slide-clicker component that can
          dispatch events to our "powerpointer-3000" machine. Attached to this
          letter you'll find a floppy disk with a copy of the powerpointer code.
          Good luck!
        </p>
        <powerpointer-3000></powerpointer-3000>
        <powerpointer-clicker>Advance slides</powerpointer-clicker>
        <script type="module">
          import { Powerpointer3000 } from '/components/powerpointer-3000.mjs'
          import { PowerpointerClicker } from '/_solutions/powerpointer-clicker.mjs'
          customElements.define('powerpointer-3000', Powerpointer3000)
          customElements.define('powerpointer-clicker', PowerpointerClicker)
        </script>

        <h2>The creativity protector</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, it's Greg from accounts. I am in need of a font-style component
          that would prevent my colleagues from overriding my text styling with
          their CSS !important rules. They say I'm not a designer and should not
          be specifying font-styles but why can't accountants be allowed to add
          some extra flair to their text?
        </p>
        <p>
          Attached below you can see an example of the styling that my
          colleagues use to supress my creative juices. Please build me a web
          component that will style and protect my precious text.
        </p>
        <style>
          .creativity-blocker {
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            padding: 12px;
          }
          .creativity-blocker p {
            font-family: sans-serif !important;
          }
        </style>
        <div class="creativity-blocker">
          <creativity-protector>
            <style>
              p {
                font-family: cursive;
              }
            </style>
            <p>
              Here's some text that I'd wish would have some extra flair! But it
              didn't help putting style attributes directly on the paragraph.
              And I cannot touch the actual CSS that we have.
            </p>
          </creativity-protector>
          <script type="module">
            import { CreativityProtector } from '/_solutions/solution-creativity-protector.mjs'
            customElements.define('creativity-protector', CreativityProtector)
          </script>
          <!-- Tip: You should create a web component that can wrap the text above so that they can get their creative juices unblocked. -->
