    <h1>Part One: Welcome to Eagleton labs</h1>
    <p>
      Hello dear, inventor-in-training. In this here lab we research and build
      web components to be used by the folks upstairs. If you do good work here
      you might one day get to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's your workstation and back there that's the coffee machine. Oh, when
      it was cleaned last? I don't know, do machines like that need cleaning?
    </p>
    <p>Nevermind.</p>
    <p>
      As you can see there's already a stack of requests on your desk for
      various web components that the upstairsfolk need to be crafted. Here's
      your complementary company mug for your coffee imbibement. I won't close
      the door on my way out so the airdraft can circulate away some of that
      mold smell. Best of luck with your work!

      <h2>The anti-styling barrier</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, it's Greg from accounts. I am in need of a font-style component that
        would prevent my colleagues from overriding my text styling with their
        CSS !important rules. They say I'm not a designer and should not be
        specifying font-styles but why can't accountants be allowed to add some
        extra flair to their text?
      </p>
      <p>
        Attached below you can see an example of the styling that my colleagues
        use to supress my creative juices. Please build me a web component that
        will style and protect my precious text.
      </p>
      <style>
        .creativity-blocker {
          border: 1px solid #ccc;
          padding: 12px;
        }
        .creativity-blocker p {
          font-family: serif !important;
        }
      </style>
      <div class="creativity-blocker">
        <p style="font-family: fantasy">
          Here's some text that I'd wish would have some extra flair! But it
          didn't help putting style attributes directly on the paragraph. And I
          cannot touch the actual CSS that we have.
        </p>
        <!-- Tip: You should create a web component that can wrap the text above so that they can get their creative juices unblocked. -->
